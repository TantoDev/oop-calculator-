# Simple OOP Calculator

This is a simple calculator I built to practice using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and to get comfortable shipping code.

I know it’s basic and there are many ways it can break—but that’s the point. I plan to improve and add more features as I learn. For now, I just wanted to push past perfectionism and post it as it is.

More projects coming soon!
